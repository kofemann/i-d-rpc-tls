    "body": "***General Comments***\r\n\r\n**Importance of this Work**\r\n\r\nThis work addresses the two biggest problems in NFSv4 security and could serve as a basis to allow secure  use of NFSv4 on the internet, which was one of the original goals of NFSv4.  My thanks to Chuck and Trond for taking this on and bringing the work to this point.\r\n\r\n**State of the Document**\r\n\r\nThis document is in good shape.   The issues I've found concern how the material is presented rather than indicating problems in the approach taken or the specific choices made.   \r\n\r\n***Per-Section Comments***\r\n\r\n**1.  Introduction**\r\n\r\nI feel that some reorganization of the second paragraph and the associated bullets would be helpful.   I think you need to decide whether the focus is to be on the diffculties of deploying RPCSEC_GSS or the difficulties of deploying RPCSEC_GSS with privacy, which, to me are more clear-cut and are really the major thing that this proposal addresses.   Note that, of the four bullets below this paragraph, only two are relevant to privacy while the paragraph after the bullets only makes sense if it speaking about RPCSEC_GSS with privacy.   It is not the case that RPCSEC_GSS is not used at all, altough it is not used as much as originally hoped.\r\n\r\nI think you might consider a replacement along the following lines:\r\n\r\n> The Remote Procedure Call version 2 protocol has been a Proposed Standard for three decades (see [RFC5531] and its antecedants). Eisler et al. first introduced an in-transit encryption mechanism for RPC with RPCSEC GSS over twenty years ago [RFC2203].  However, experience has shown that RPCSEC GSS with in-transit encryption can be difficult to deploy and use:\r\n> \r\n> - Parts of each RPC header remain in clear-text, and can constitute a significant security exposure.\r\n> - On-host cryptographic manipulation of data payloads can exact a significant CPU and memory bandwidth cost on RPC peers. Offloadng does not appear to be practical using GSS privacy since each message is encrypted using its own key based on the issuing RPC user. As a result, the performance penalty is so significant that, for many important RPC-based protocols, RPCSEC_GSS wiith privacy is hardly ever used.\r\n> \r\n> However strong a privacy service is, it cannot provide any security if the challenges of using it result in it not being used at all.\r\n> In addition, the use of AUTH_SYS remains common despite the negative effect on security that server acceptnce of uids and gids from unauthenticated clients brings with it.   This is in part because:\r\n> \r\n> - Per-client deployment and administrative costs are not scalable and, in many environments may be considered excessive. Keying material must be provided for each RPC client user, including transient users.\r\n> - Host identity management and user identity management must be carried out in the same security realm.  In certain environments, different authorities might be responsible for provisioning client systems versus provisioning new users.\r\n> \r\n> Through the use of TLS-aided client authentication these difficulties can be addressed without the security compromises that result from the use of AUTH_SYS, without client authentication and in the clear.\r\n\r\nAt the the start of the third (non-bulleted) paragraph, suggest replacing \"an alternative approach\" by \"The Alternative approach proposed here\".\r\n\r\nWith regard to your benefits paragraphs I feel some reorganization could be helpful to render the presentation more impactful:\r\n\r\n- While \"Encryption by default\" is strong, it would better if it was immediately followed up by the second major benefit \"Encryption Offload\".\r\n- I feel it is a mistake to mention AUTH_SYS where you do, before telling people you have rendered it more safe.  So \"Decoupled User and Host Identities\" should appear after \"Securing AUTH_SYS\" and be revised in light of the fact that AUTH_SYS has been rendered OK (e.g. changing \"still using\" to \"safely using\").\r\n- \"Protection of Existing Protocols\" should not be listed among these benefits since the first sentence of the paragraph is true of RPCSEC_GSS as well.   I think you can add some of this material to a revised penultimate paragraph as I suggest below.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the penultimate paragraph of this section, I'm suggesting a revision to \r\n\r\n- Incorporate material  from \"Protection of Existing Protocols\" \r\n- Eliminate the reference to RFC7435 (entitled \"Opportunistic Security: Some Protection Most of the Time\").  \r\n\r\nAlthough both this document and \"opportunistic TLS\" use the word \"opportunistic\",  they are effectively homonyms and referencing RFC7435 adds confusion.\r\n\r\nWould like you to consider the following replacement paragraphs:\r\n\r\n> This document specifies the use of RPC on a TLS-protected transport in a fashion that is transparent to upper layer protocols based on RPC. This transport layer encryption can protect all minor versions of  NFS version 4 [RFC7530][RFC5661][RFC7862] as well legacy NFS versions such as NFS version 3 [RFC1813], NFS side-band protocols such as the MNT protocol [RFC1813] and other protocols using RPC.\r\n> \r\n> We specify policies that enable RPC-on-TLS to be deployed opportunistically in environments with RPC implementations that do not support TLS.  Specifications for RPC-based upper layer protocols are free to adopt stricter policies to guarantee that TLS with encryption or TLS with host authentication and encryption is used for every connection or that  connections for which these facilities are not available are restricted as to the facilities they are allowed to use.\r\n\r\n**4.2.1.  Using TLS with RPCSEC GSS**\r\n\r\nI don't think the word \"client\" in the second paragraph is correct.  IIUC, it is the requesting user rather than the client itself that is authenticated. \r\n\r\n**5.1.3.  Operation on Other Transports**\r\n\r\nIn the third sntence of the first paragraph, suggest:\r\n\r\n- replacing \"provisions\" by \"other provisions\"\r\n- replacing \"could\" by \"would need to be\"\r\n\r\nIn the first sentence of the second pragraph, suggest replacing \"accommodated\" by \"addressed\".\r\nIn the second sentence ofthe second paragraph, suggest replacing \"might\" by \"would\"\r\n\r\n**7.2.  Multiple User Identity Realms**\r\n\r\nI don't see how establishing an independent TLS session for each user identity domain would prevent privileged users in each security realm from monitoring RPC traffic emitted on behalf of users in other security realms on the same peer.  What am I missing?   Are there some unstated assumptions about what privileged users might be allowed to do?\r\n\r\n**7.3.  Security Considerations for AUTH_SYS on TLS**\r\n\r\nWith regard to the penultimate paragraph, I don't see how this recommendation, desirable as it is, can provide any assurance that clients are \"acting responsibly\"  Suggest the following as a possible replacement:\r\n\r\n> In light of the above, it is RECOMMENDED that when AUTH_SYS is used, RPC clients present authentication material to  RPC servers and that servers use this material to determine if the client is a known one, so that they can make a determination whther the UIDs and GIDs in AUTH_SYS requests can be accepted as-is, subject to some degree some filtering or montitoring, or whther all AUTH_SYS requests on this connection are to be rejected. \r\n\r\nWith regard to the last sentence of the last paragraph, I think it should be noted that this issue could be addressed by not having names for these users and using numeric id's instead."

    "body": "Reviewer: Derrell Piper\r\nReview result: Not Ready\r\n\r\nI reviewed this document as part of the security directorate's ongoing\r\neffort to review all IETF documents entering the IESG.  These comments\r\nare directed at the security area director(s).  Document editors and WG\r\nchairs should treat these comments like any other last call comments.\r\n\r\nThis draft is entitled, \"Remote Procedure Call Encryption by Default\",\r\nexcept it does not define this.  It instead discusses opportunistic RPC\r\nencryption using TLS (DTLS), encryption that might be used if the sun,\r\nmoon, and stars align, and likely only if you're running one of two NFS\r\nimplementations mentioned in this draft, which exclude most existing NFS\r\nservers on the Internet today and is incompatible with Linux (pp. 13).\r\n\r\nTo some extent, this draft simply defines a new enum in ONC RPC, named\r\nAUTH_TLS.  It completely handwaves all code changes in RPC and NFS to\r\nsupport TLS, PKI, GSS-API, or DNSSEC.  It contains no pseudocode, just\r\nRFC2119 MUST, MAYs, and SHOULDs.\r\n\r\npp. 5, Discovery\r\n\r\n\"The mechanism described in this document interoperates fully with RPC\r\nimplementations that do not support TLS. The use of TLS is automatically\r\ndisabled in these cases.\"\r\n\r\nHence, Not Ready.\r\n\r\nI have great sympathy for wanting to try to make it possible to use TLS\r\nby default in new NFS servers that support it, however even then, I\r\nthink this draft falls short.  It seems self-contradictory at times, and\r\nseems to continue to default to off, not on, which is exactly what\r\nRFC7258 says we ought not be doing anymore.\r\n\r\nOr maybe it doesn't intend to say this, since Token binding and TLSA are\r\nmentioned in Security Considerations, but optional, so it kinda does.\r\nSo, defer to the ADs.\r\n\r\npp. 6, Discovery\r\n\r\n\"Once the TLS handshake is complete, the RPC client and server will have\r\nestablished a secure channel for communicating.  The client MUST switch\r\nto a security flavor other than AUTH_TLS within that channel, presumably\r\nafter negotiating down redundant RPCSEC_GSS privacy and integrity\r\nservices and applying channel binding.\"\r\n\r\nWhat are the code changes?  GSS-API is subtle, please explain.  Are\r\nthere really no TLS or DTLS changes for any of this?\r\n\r\npp. 6, Discovery, STARTTLS discussion\r\n\r\nONC RPC person needed.  The AUTH_NONE and NULL RPC text is of concern.\r\n\r\npp. 7, Authentication\r\n\r\n\"If authentication of either peer fails, or if authorization based on\r\nthose identities blocks access to the server, the client association\r\nSHOULD be rejected.\"\r\n\r\nMUST be rejected.\r\n\r\npp. 7, Authentication\r\n\r\n\"Once a TLS session is established, the server MUST NOT utilize the\r\nclient peer's TLS identity for the purpose of authorizing individual RPC\r\nrequests.\"\r\n\r\nThat's a curious statement to end a section on Authentication with.  At\r\nleast justify that statement.\r\n\r\npp. 8, TLS Requirements\r\n\r\n\"Support for TLS-PSK mutual authentication [RFC4279] is OPTIONAL.\"\r\n\r\nConsidering this is retrofit security for a legacy UNIX UID/GID\r\nprotocol, making PSKs OPTIONAL almost seems quaint here, but okay.\r\n\r\npp. 8, TLS Requirements\r\n\r\n\"Support for and negotiation of compression is OPTIONAL.\"  Noted.\r\n\r\npp. 9, Operation on Other Transports\r\n\r\n\"Transports that provide intrinsic TLS-level security (e.g. QUIC) would\r\nneed to be accomodated separatey from the current document.  In such\r\ncases, use of TLS might not be opportunistic as it is for TCP or UDP.\"\r\n\r\n\"opportunitic\" is misspelled, and I don't know what to make of this\r\nsentence, but I have very partisan views on QUIC, so defer to the ADs.\r\n\r\nI assume Section 5.1.3 is there for RDMA but it doesn't say anything.\r\n\r\npp. 11, X.509 Certificates Using Fingerprints\r\n\r\n\"Implementations MUST support SHA-1 as the hash algorithm for the\r\nfingerprint.  To prevent attacks based on hash collisions, support for a\r\nmore contemporary hash function, such as SHA-256, is RECOMMENDED.\"\r\n\r\nSHA-1's deprecated, right?  So we shoudn't be mandating SHA-1 in new\r\nRFCs, right?  Defer to AD.\r\n\r\npp. 11 Pre-Shared Keys\r\n\r\n\"should be exposed\" -> \"SHOULD be exposed\"\r\n\r\npp. 12, DESY, Hammerspace, and Linux\r\n\r\nWhy are these two implementations called out?  This section does not\r\ngive me confidence that this all interoperates, is it supposed to?\r\n\r\npp. 13, Security Considerations\r\n\r\nSince absolute compatibilty with fielded insecure NFS is stated as a\r\nrequirement, the obvious downgrade attack is not only permitted, but\r\nrequired.  Again, RFC7258 says that's no longer acceptable, doesn't it?\r\nnAgain, defer to the ADs.\r\n\r\n\"Implementations must take care to accurately represent to all RPC\r\nconsumers the level of security that is actually in effect.\"  How?\r\n\r\npp. 14, Security Considerations for AUTH_SYS on TLS\r\n\r\n\"In light of the above, it is RECOMMENDED that when AUTH_SYS is used,\r\nRPC clients present authentication material necessary for RPC servers\r\nthey contact to have a degree of trust that the clients are acting\r\nresponsibly.\"\r\n\r\nHence, \"if the sun, moon, and stars align.\"  Again, this is not in the\r\nspirit of RFC7258.  And just to remind, AUTH_SYS doesn't make sense on\r\nnon-UNIX operating systems, but that perhaps is my partisan viewpoint.\r\n\r\nIn closing, there's two broad questions to consider:\r\n\r\n1) Does this do no harm?\r\n\r\n2) Does it improve security on the Internet in the spirit of RFC7258?\r\n\r\nThis is going to have to be much more detailed to convince me that it\r\ndoes either of these things for any implementation other than DESY or\r\nHammerspace, and without other reference implemenatation in the BSDs or\r\na least some flavors of Linux, you can't say this broadly interoperable\r\neither.  Distributed file systems are never easy, hence DCE/AFS, so\r\ngranted it's not an easy problem, but this is not ready to advance on\r\nStandards Track, unless merely being interoperable with legacy code is\r\nall we aspire to, and I sincerely hope it's not.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this needle can be threaded and with appropriate configuration\r\nby enterprising people, TLS can be configured with DNSSEC and GSS-API in\r\nRPC and NFS and it will do something reasonable and secure, but I would\r\nlike to see at least some more comments from implementation experience\r\nbefore I could recommend this advance.\r\n\r\nDerrell"

    "body": "Regarding the last paragraph of the introduction, I think you have to clarify what you mean by \"opportunistic\" and recognize that \"opportunistic\" as used in the phrase \"opportunistic TLS\" and in RFC 7435 are really homonyms.   I'm going to suggest something like the following two paragraphs as a possible replacement:\r\n\r\nThis document specifies the use of RPC on a TLS-protected transport in a fashion that is transparent to upper layer protocols based on RPC. It is specfied to use opportunistic TLS, enabling use of RPC-on-TLS to be deployed in environments with implentations that do not support it.  Specifications for RPC-based upper layer protocols are free to require stricter policies to guarantee that TLS is used for each connection.\r\n\r\nClient authentication is provided for using the opportnitunstic approach specified in [RFC7435], allowing encryption to be used even when authenitication is not. However, specifications  for RPC-based upper layer protocols are free to require stricter policies to guarantee the client is always authenticated or always authenticated when certain secrity flavors (e.g. AUTH_SYS) are used.\r\n\r\nIn section 4.1, I'm not clear about the relevance of the last sentence of the first paragraph.  While the tatement is true, it doesn't appear relevant to the matter being discussed.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the two deployment modes, I suggest that what they share (a server cerificate) should be made clearer by pulling thi assumption into the second paragraph.   Also I'm concened about overuse of the term \"SHOULD\".   In some cases (e.g. the \"SHOULD\" now in the second paragraph) I have no idea what circumstance might justify not doing rhe recommended action, while in other cases it appear that the i just describing the way the protocol works and that \"SHOULD\" might suggest a choice where there really isn't one, leading to a large set of deplyment modes, rather than just two.  So here is possible replacement text to consider.   \r\n\r\nIn all cases a server is to posess a unique global identity (e.g., a certificate that is signed by a well-known trust anchor) . The RPC server MUST request a TLS peer identity from each client upon first contact.  The availabilit of such client identities and how the absence of such identities are dealt with permits two deployment modes:\r\n\r\nServer-only Host Authentication\r\n\r\nIn this case, clients are anonymous (i.e., present no identifier or any identifier presented ). In this situation, the client will authenticate the server host using the presented TLS identity, but the server cannot authenticate clients.\r\nMutual Host Authentication\r\n\r\nIn this type of deployment, all clients are to possess unique identities (e.g., certificates). As part of the TLS handshake, both peers authenticate using the presented TLS identities. If authentication of either peer fails, or if authorization based on those identities blocks access to the server, the client association is to be rejected.\r\nIn the second sentence of the first paragraph of section 4.2.1, suggest replacing \"disabled\" by \"avoided\".\r\n\r\nI'm concrerned abou the use of the term \"RECOMMENDED\" in the first bullet in secttion 7.1.1.  I think thisshould be changed to \"recommended\".   With \"RECOMMENDED\", the natural interpretation is that you SHOULD do A but MUST do B if you don't.   However, you don't have to do any of it since that would invalidate the opportunistic nature of the whole thing. \r\n\r\nSection 7.2 really confuses me.   First of all it isn't made very clear what \"multiple distinct security realms\" means although it is natural to assume that they correspond to the multiiple \"identity domains\" mentioned in the second paragraph.\r\n\r\nif that's the case., I don't see how use of the same tls session by the client would compormise the \"privacty of RPC users\"  if the requestring user are x@a.org and y@b.rg any more than they would be compromised by use by users x@a.org and y@a.org (i.e. not at all).   i suspect that this comes from the security directorate.  If so, it makes sense to ask them to clarify exactly what they want and why.\r\n\r\nI'd like to suggest the following as a possible replacement for the third paragraph of section 7.3:\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, it is RECOMMENDED that AUTH_SYS is to be used, RPC clients present authentication material necessary for RPC servers they contact to have a degree of trust that the clients are acting responsibly.  \r\n\r\nIn the second sentence of the last paragraph of suggest adding \"in addition,\" at the start of the sentence.\r\n\r\nSuggest replacing the last (unnumbered) paragraph of Appendix A by the following:\r\n\r\nIn light of the avbove, it should be clear that AUTH_SYS therefore by itself offers little to no communication security:  \r\n\r\nIn item 2, suggest replacing \"real\" by \"actual\".\r\n\r\nFInally, I'd like to to suggest the following as a replacement for section 5.1,3:\r\n\r\n5.1.3. Potential Operation on other Transports\r\nThe RPC-over-RDMA transport can make use of Transport Layer Security below the RDMA transport layer [RFC8166]. The exact mechanism is not within the scope of this document.   Because there might not provisions made to exchange client and server certificates, authentication material might be provide by facilites with the RPC-over-RDMA transport [TBD].\r\n\r\nTransports that provide tls-level security [e.g.  QUIC] would need to be accommodated, even though, in such cases, use of TLS is not opportunitic as it is in the cases in which TCP or UDP is used.
